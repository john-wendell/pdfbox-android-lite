pdfbox-android-lite
==============

A lightweight port of Apache's PdfBox library to be usable on Android.
This implementation is forked from the PdfBox-Android project.

It's main goal is to reduce the size
of the library. Therefore I've removed the PDF encryption and security support as well as some unused resources.
The size of the library is reduced from approximately 7.4MB to almost 1.1MB.
